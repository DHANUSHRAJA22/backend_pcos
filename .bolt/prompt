This backend should represent the state-of-the-art in medical AI systems, combining multiple cutting-edge models with advanced ensemble techniques, comprehensive interpretability, and production-ready operational capabilities.Project: PCOS Analyzer – Multi-Model Ensemble AI Backend
Objective
Build a research-grade FastAPI backend for the PCOS Analyzer project that maximally improves medical image classification by leveraging multiple state-of-the-art deep learning models per modality (face photos and uterus X-rays) and combining their outputs with advanced ensemble and stacking/boosting logic.

Key Principles
Model Accuracy First: Prioritize correct model loading, inference, and accurate ensemble decision logic over any security, authentication, or UI concerns.

Multi-Model Ensemble: For each task (face and X-ray analysis), always load and serve predictions from at least 5 of the strongest model architectures, not just one.

Flexible Ensemble Logic: Implement soft voting, weighted voting (configured by user), and stacking/meta-model (XGBoost or logistic regression) to combine predictions. Allow configuration of which ensemble method is used at runtime.

Modularity: Each model and ensemble logic must be plug-and-play, easily extendable or swappable. Clearly document with comments and # TODO where new models or methods should be added.

Transparency: API responses must include per-model outputs as well as all ensemble outcomes for interpretability and research auditing.

No Security/UI: Omit all security layers, authentication, or frontend code—focus exclusively on backend ML engineering.

Required Endpoints
POST /predict:

Accept multipart form (face_img, xray_img).

For each provided input, run all configured models and return:

List of per-model predictions and confidences.

The final combined/ensemble prediction(s) from all requested ensemble methods.

If using a meta-stack (XGBoost/LogReg), include its result separately.

GET /health:

Return status, available models, ensemble logic config, and ready-state.

(Optional for CLI): Add utilities for batch evaluation and ensemble experimentation.

Architecture & File Expectations
Project root: backend/ with logical modular structure (models/, ensemble.py, utils/, schemas.py, config.py, etc.)

Use Pydantic/OpenAPI for all schemas, thorough code comments, and modular file design.

Default all ensemble/config to be editable in a config file or via API, not hard-coded.

All logic (model loading, voting, stacking, response) must be clean, auditable, and easily reusable for experiments.
